hi this beautiful and fantastic
it was a beautiful day and it was shining a bit
there was a litte rain like few droplets falling from the beautiful blue sky
i was going to the shop to buy bread and omlet
so that i can enjoy my evening with coffee
i heard a big sound where a huge tree fell on the ground
the tree was very old some 250 years old
it had a nest which also fell the eggs broke and the birds were sitting near the nest
